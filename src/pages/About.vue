          RewardKit App

        </p>
        <p>As a parent, I am deeply troubled by the the fact that my kid seems to be addicted to the screens, phone,
          TV, iPad, computer, you name it.
          No matter how I restrict his screen time, It doesn't seeem very effective. Especially that, even
          when I remove the screens, I failed to channel his energy or motivate him to do other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things that do not gratify him instantly, things that need long time efforts to build to see any effect,
          things that are not easy and even painful for adults.
        </p>
        <p>Tried shouting, yelling, reasoning, anything. But they are not long term solutions. And I definitely don't
          like to turn myself into a tiger parent or a monster for that matter. Then one day I decided to have an App,
          that can help me keep tracks of tasks given and the rewards the kids can claim from completing these tasks
          and let's just call it <a class="font-bold text-purple-650">A win-win reward system</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is how I usually apply it to our schedule.
          Every weekend, we make a deal of what is required to be done next week. And for each task completed, a reward
          can be claimed,
          but game type of rewards can only be claimed at the weekend.

          Some of the typical tasks look like:
        <ul class="mt-3">
          <li>
            <strong>Daily</strong> <a class="text-purple-650"> Practise Drum</a>: 30 minutes => Game: 10 minutes
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Every Tuesday</strong> <a class="text-purple-650"> English reading</a>: 60 minutes => iphone: 30
            minutes

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Every Thursday</strong> <a class="text-purple-650"> Spelling quiz practice</a>: 60 minutes => Game:
            20 minutes
          </li>

        </ul>

        </p>

        <p class="mt-3">
          <strong>Summary - Friday Night: </strong> game x 60 minutes
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-purple-650">So far it works out pretty good. Thank GOD! Hope it works for you too!<a
